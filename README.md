# Project2 - Spotashow


This awesome project was created rapidly, within less than a week, for a class project.

This public repository is for the administration of Spotashow, Project-Two. The purpose of this application is for a user to login, search an artist and then render information of that artist and their events / concerts. A map will appear with nearby events using the user's geolocation and give you the ability to purchase tickets to that event using Ticketmaster. 

## Login
This application is designed with a login feature where a user can login if they are a returning user or create an account with their email & password if they are a new user. The login feature uses the Passport NPM package and stores that information in MySQL Workbench via Sequelize.
